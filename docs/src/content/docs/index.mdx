<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Caution!" icon="error">
		This repository is an educational example for learning Nginx, Reverse-proxy and network security basics. This script demonstrates Nginx configuration as a reverse-proxy.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Server Uses Nginx Reverse-Proxy" icon="seti:powershell">
		This script is designed to streamline the setup of a reverse proxy server using NGINX and Xray, as well as to automate the installation of the Remnawave control panel and node.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Script's configuration" icon="seti:config">
		In this configuration, Xray operates directly on port 443, forwarding traffic through a socket that NGINX listens to. This approach minimizes unnecessary TCP overhead, delivering improved performance and connection reliability.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Attention!" icon="warning">
		Not for prod and not for production use! If you don't understand how the control panel works - that's your problem, not the script author's. Use at your own risk!
